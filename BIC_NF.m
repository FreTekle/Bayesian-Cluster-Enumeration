% Inputs:
%        num_features - a scalar containing the number of features in the data set
%        est_num_samples_cluster - a vector containing the estimated number of samples in each cluster
%        est_cluster_covmats - a cell containing the estimated cluster covariance matrices
%        dup_mat - duplication matrix of the covariance matrix


% Outputs:
%        data_term - data fidelty term of BIC_NF 
%        penalty_term - penalty term of BIC_NF
%        BIC - the calculated Bayesian information criterion
