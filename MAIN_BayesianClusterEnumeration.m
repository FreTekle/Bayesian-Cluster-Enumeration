%% User inputs
spec_num_clusters = 1:10; % the number of clusters specified by a family of candidate models
num_samples_cluster = 100; % number of samples per cluster
criterion = 'BIC_N'; % type of cluster enumeration criterion % possible inputs are 'BIC_N', 'BIC_NF', 'BIC_O', 'BIC_OS' (See [1] and [2] for details on the criteria)
plotting = 1; % if set to 1 it plots the raw data and the calculated Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) as a function of the specified number of clusters by the candidate models 

%% Generate data
[data, num_features, num_samples_total, num_clusters] = generateData(num_samples_cluster, plotting);

%% Perform Bayesian cluster enumeration
[est_num_clusters, est_cluster_centroids, est_cluster_covmats] = performBayesianClusterEnumeration(data, num_features, num_samples_total, criterion, spec_num_clusters, num_clusters, plotting);
