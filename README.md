We have derived a new Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) from first principles by formulating the problem of estimating the number of clusters in an observed data set as maximization of the posterior probability of the candidate models. This results in an asymptotic BIC criterion for multivariate Gaussian distributed observations. Further, finite-sample refinements has been made to the criterion.
