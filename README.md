# Bayesian Cluster Enumeration Algorithms

We have recently derived a new Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) from first principles by formulating the problem of estimating the number of clusters in an observed data set as maximization of the posterior probability of the candidate models. Given that some mild assumptions are satisfied, we provided a general BIC expression for a broad class of data distributions. Taking the multivariate Gaussian distribution as a specific case, we provided a closed-form BIC expression and further refined the criterion for the finite sample regime.
