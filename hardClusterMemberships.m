%% Using the clustering results of the model based clustering function (modelBasedClustering.m), this function provides hard cluster memberships to each data point in

% Inputs:
%        spec_num_cluster - a scalar containing the number of clusters specified by a candidate model
%        est_prob - a matric containing the estimated probability of membership of each sample to each cluster


% Outputs: 
%         cluster_labels - hard cluster memberships
%         est_num_samples_cluster - estimated number of samples in each cluster


function [cluster_labels, est_num_samples_cluster] = hardClusterMemberships(est_prob, spec_num_cluster)

    [~,cluster_labels] = max(est_prob,[],2);
    est_num_samples_cluster = zeros(1,spec_num_cluster);

    for m = 1:spec_num_cluster
        est_num_samples_cluster(m) = sum(m==cluster_labels);
